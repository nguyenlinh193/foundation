# Front-End Development Checklist
## Functional Testing
- [ ] Verify all buttons, links, and forms are functioning as expected.
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements respond correctly (hover, click, focus, etc.).
- [ ] Test all form validations (required fields, correct input formats, etc.).
- [ ] Confirm data is displayed correctly and updates in real-time if applicable.
## Visual and UI/UX
- [ ] Check alignment, spacing, and layout consistency with design specifications.
- [ ] Ensure font sizes, colors, and styles match the design mockups.
- [ ] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- [ ] Verify the screen looks consistent across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
## Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure all images have appropriate alt text.
- [ ] Check that the screen is navigable using the keyboard.
- [ ] Confirm that color contrasts meet accessibility standards.
- [ ] Use a screen reader to test the accessibility of the screen.
## Performance
- [ ] Verify that the screen loads quickly and efficiently.
- [ ] Check for any large images or files that can be optimized.
- [ ] Ensure lazy loading is implemented for images and other media if applicable.
- [ ] Test the screen's performance using tools like Google Lighthouse or GTmetrix.
## Code Quality
- [ ] Review the code for readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Ensure there are no console errors or warnings.
- [ ] Confirm that the code adheres to the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- [ ] Remove any commented-out code or unnecessary console logs.
## Security
- [ ] Validate that sensitive data is not exposed in the frontend.
- [ ] Ensure that input fields are protected against XSS attacks.
- [ ] Confirm that API keys and sensitive information are not hard-coded.
## Documentation
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made.
- [ ] Add comments to the code where necessary to explain complex logic.
- [ ] Document any third-party libraries or plugins used and why.
## Final Review
- [ ] Conduct a peer review or code review with another team member.
