# Pull Request conventions

## Branch name
```
<prefix>/<task ID>-<task name>
```
- <b>Prefix</b>: Using prefixes in branch names helps to quickly identify the purpose of the branches. Here are some common types of branches with their corresponding prefixes:
  - <b>Feature Branches</b>: These branches are used for developing new features. Use the prefix `feature/`. For instance, `feature/login-system`.
  - <b>Bugfix Branches</b>: These branches are used to fix bugs in the code. Use the prefix `bugfix/`. For example, `bugfix/header-styling`.
  - <b>Hotfix Branches</b>: These branches are made directly from the production branch to fix critical bugs in the production environment. Use the prefix `hotfix/`. For instance, `hotfix/critical-security-issue`.
  - <b>Release Branches</b>: These branches are used to prepare for a new production release. Use the prefix `release/`. For example, `release/v1.0.1`.
  - <b>Documentation Branches</b>: These branches are used to write, update, or fix documentation. Use the prefix `docs/`. For instance, `docs/api-endpoints`.
- <b>Task ID</b>: is the Task ID on Redmine or the other task management tool
- <b>Task name</b>: is the name of the task in KebabCase

#### Examples
- The Redmine task: `#2131 [FE] Implement api add device`
  
  The branch name: `feature/2131-implement-api-add-device`

## Commit
### Commit message
The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. <b>fix</b>: a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase.
2. <b>feat</b>: a commit of the type `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase.
3. <b>BREAKING CHANGE</b>: a commit that appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change.
4. <i>types</i> other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional recommends `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.

#### Examples
- Commit message with description
  ```
  feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs
  ```
- Commit message with ! to draw attention to breaking change
  ```
  feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
  ```
- Commit message with scope and ! to draw attention to breaking change
  ```
  feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
  ```

## Pull Request description

### Format:

```
## What?
## Why?
## How?
## Testing?
## Screenshots (optional)
## Anything Else?
```

### What
Explain the changes you've made
#### Example
```
## What?
I've added support for authentication to implement Key Result 2 of OKR1. It includes
model, table, controller and test. For more background, see ticket #2131.
```

### Why
The “why” tells us what business or engineering goal this change achieves
#### Example
```
## Why?
These changes complete the user login and account creation experience. See #2131 for more information.
```

### How
#### Example
```
## How?
This includes a migration, model and controller for user authentication. I'm using Devise to do the heavy lifting. I ran Devise migrations and those are included here.
```

### Testing
Some conditions or edge cases were tested and not tested, why they weren't tested, how likely they will occur, and if so, any associated risks.

The testing checklist you can referent [here](/development/testing/developer-checklist)

## Testing?
- Functional Testing: Pass
- Security: Pass
- Performance: Pass
- Error Handling: 75%
  - Check for efficient use of resources (CPU, memory): The used CPU increases 25% when using login API. Will improve on the next PR 
- Code Quality: Pass
- Documentation: Pass
- Database: Pass
- Deployment: Pass
- Final Review: Pass

## Anything Else?
Let's consider using a 3rd party authentication provider for this, to offload MFA and other considerations as they arise and as the privacy landscape evolves. AWS Cognito is a good option, so is Firebase. I'm happy to start researching this path. Let's also consider breaking this out into its own service. We can then re-use it or share the accounts with other apps in the future.
