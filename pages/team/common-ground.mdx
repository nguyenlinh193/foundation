# Common Ground

>Work ethic is about showing up, being on time, being reliable, doing what you say you’re going to do, being trustworthy, putting in a fair day’s work, respecting the work, respecting the customer, respecting the organization, respecting co-workers, not wasting time, not making work hard for other people, not creating unnecessary work for other people, not being a bottleneck, not faking work. Work ethic is about being a fundamentally good person that others can count on and enjoy working with. –
**Jason Fried, Founder & CEO at Basecamp**

>If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect or talk down to someone, I promise you, I will fire you on the spot — on the spot. No ifs ands or buts. - **Joe Biden, 46th U.S. President**

As a team, we strongly believe in work ethics as explained in the above quote, and consider it as the basis of how everyone should be.

In this section, practical details - that we all need to be aligned with - are covered.

## Core Hours

Our working hours are fixed from 8:30 to 18:00, Monday to Friday, with an 8-hour workday excluding the lunch break (12:00 to 13:30). Everyone is required to start working at the office by 8:30 at the latest.

As we operate within the service industry, it is imperative for us to ensure our availability to clients during their business hours. Therefore, each project team should be able to request (to the accountant and director) the modification of their working time frame to align with client requirements, facilitating demonstrations, discussions, and deployments.

> Those core hours are 8:30 to 18:00 (Hanoi/Vietnam time, GMT+7).

The goal is to have all teammates together and available for each other for at least 8 hours/day.

## Trust & Fairness

We entrust our team to provide the expected amount of work and to remain effective. Everyone must play by the rules to avoid friction and conflicts.

If someone doesn’t “pull their own weight” and deliver their fair share of work, their teammates will have to pick up the slack.

At the same time, not providing fast enough when a client needs us will lead to dissatisfaction. In the worst of cases, it could even lead to the loss of a client.

Being trustworthy and fair during working in the office or remotely is a cornerstone to the health of the team and the company.

## Food

- Snacks and drinks are offered in the office and can be consumed by everyone. Food is usually re-stocked twice a month.
- Every teammate is allowed to bring his/her own food and consume it on-premises at any time.
- Punctual team events are sometimes organized but there is no fixed obligation to eat lunch together or at the same time.
- No alcoholic drinks in the office, only allowed on premises during team building events.

## Noise

We understand that you might want to connect and discuss with your teammates in person. However, keep in mind that noise can cause significant distractions and create a loss of productivity for other teammates.

> Be courteous to others by keeping conversations at a low noise level, and keep the music to yourself 🎧.
> After 17:00, we can use the speaker to warm up the office atmosphere a little, however, keep it enough to warm up, not burn the office.

## Assets

Teammates are eligible to request to use the company’s equipment: Macbook Pro (with the Development team), Macbook Air (with Accountant, HR, QA team) iMac (with the Design team), Mobile devices (Mobile development team), etc., with the condition that teammates will need to come to pick up and return the equipment in-person.

With the same MacOS environment, we are easier to support, transfer data, code debugging, tools sharing, etc., each other.
